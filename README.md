Shortest Path Finder Using Dijkstra's Algorithm

Overview: This project implements Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph, represented by an adjacency matrix. The user provides the graph via a text file, and the program outputs the shortest path and its cost.

Features:
- Reads graph input from a text file
- Graph represented as an adjacency matrix with positive integer weights
- Computes shortest path between user-defined source and destination using Dijkstra's algorithm
- Outputs path and total cost
